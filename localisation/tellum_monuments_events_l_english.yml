 elkazur.1.t:0 "The Tree Awakens"

 elkazur.1.b:0 "My mind tells me to go right."
 elkazur.2.t:0 "The Tree Blooms"
 elkazur.2.d:0 "Elkazur's black leaves begin to shine an almost sickening green. An ominous energy pulsates from the tree as the emerald orcs watch in awe and fear. Elkazur leans in closer and whispers something into your ear. "My child, what do you think is more important? The trunk of a tree that keeps it from falling over, or the reach of the leaves that dominate its surroundings. I'll leave the choice to you. Stability... or dread."
 elkazur.2.a:0 "Consuming Dread, Break our Enemy's will!"
 elkazur.2.b:0 "Foundational Stability. For we are nothing if we fall."
 elkazur.3.t:0 "Elkazur Pierces The Sky"
 elkazur.3.d:0 "As the tree grows to unimaginable heights, the nearby plants begin to glow with the same ominous emerald energy. Even being near the tree causes most of the orcs around you to fall to their knees. Elkazur opens an eye at the base of his trunk and stares at you. "Your choices up until now were correct, child. I only have one question remaining for you. Where does your strength lie? Is it in your axe, or is it in your people?"
 elkazur.3.a:0 "My Axe"
 elkazur.3.b:0 "My People"

 artificer.3.t:0 "The General's Mech Suit"
 artificer.3.d:0 "The generals of our nation approach the scientist with greed evident in their eyes. The plans for a massive mech have been constructed and only need one more detail. "General, what should we put on the right arm?"
 artificer.3.a:0 "A cannon, to blast our enemies from afar."
 artificer.3.b:0 "A blade, to relish in the blood of combat."

 korgus.1.t:0 "A Worthy Opponent"
 korgus.1.d:0 "As the Korgus Arena opens, the officials must decide for the sake of the nation who our opponents will be. There are plenty of monsters and animals for our great contestants to test their blades out on. But, maybe the people want something a little more interesting."

 korgus.2.b:0 "Maybe this isn't the best idea"
 korgus.3.t:0 "A Monster Arrives to the Arena"
 korgus.3.d:0 "A few minutes ago, people were laughing at the challenger in front of them. He was merely a human child. Humans were already weak, but a child! Though, to everyone's surprise, when the fight started, the boy masterfully moved his blade about. As the crowd began to look with interest, he called forth black flames that only the Great Dookan himself could've summoned. Within seconds, all the opponents in the arena were bloodied and seared. As the boy places his foot on the mountain of corpses he created, he looks up at you and glares."
 korgus.3.a:0 "These humans are stronger than we thought"
 korgus.3.b:0 "Well, that was fun. Time for the second round!"
 korgus.3.c:0 "This boy is stronger than I could ever be"
 korgus.4.t:0 "The Age of Black Fire"
 korgus.4.d:0 "The black throne is mine. The Great Dookan chose me to bathe this world in the black flames of destruction. I will sear my name into the enemies that oppose me.

 korgus.4.a:0 "The Black Throne is Mine"
vampire.1.t:0 "The Guests of Jade"
vampire.1.d:0 "Time was spent drafting the plans for the new home of the Black Jade Citadel. The construction seemed to smile in its new regal environment. As you admire the recent work on the citadel in the throne room, you spot a few harimari walking up to you. They all bow. Your advisor explains that these men are some of the most prolific minds in all of Yanshen. What will you do with them?"
vampire.1.a:0 "Talent is always needed in this court"
vampire.1.b:0 "Hmmm, I've never tried Harimari before"
vampire.2.t:0 "Quest for the Black Jade"
vampire.2.d:0 "A strange old man walks inside the now awe-inducing throne room. As you place your fist on your chin, waiting for the elder to speak, a translator walks up. The man speaks in signs and you begrudgingly wait until the translator interprets. "You think you have power, how foolish." Your eyes widen as the translator shakily interprets the message. As she reads your face, she stops, but you beckon her to continue. "Any man sitting upon the black jade throne without the guidance of the twin black jades is an imposter to our heritage." Your eyes narrow as you speak to the man, "And where might these twin black jades be?" The old man smirks and begins talking in sign language with his hands. "They are on opposite sides of the planet. They are siblings after all, and they fight much like we do." The interpreter continues, "The power held within one black jade is enough to turn a razed village into a metropolis, or... a man into a god. I warn you though, these black jades hate each other. You may only choose one.""
vampire.2.a:0 "Very Well, gather some troops to visit the Demon Hills"
vampire.2.b:0 "I'll send an expedition to Alentir. We have business there anyway"
vampire.3.t:0 "The Black Jade's Choice"
vampire.3.d:0 "A group of battered soldiers make their way inside the throne room. You notice that one collapses from exhaustion before even bowing.

vampire.3.a:0 "Court Mages! Lock this in the vault and begin siphoning power"
vampire.3.b:0 "Finally, it's mine"
vampire.4.t:0 "Agony"
vampire.4.d:0 "As days pass, you are unable to leave your room due to the constant pain the Black Jade radiates. Your skin has begun to peel off, and the veins on your body have morphed into jet black snakes that seem to siphon instead of replinish"
vampire.4.a:0 "When will this pain end?"
vampire.5.t:0 "A Path to Choose"
vampire.5.d:0 "As the days continue to pass by, your sanity begins to dwindle. At this point, you have even forgotten your name. As the last shreds of realism break away from your mind, the walls around you begin to morph. Everything around you turns black and the only colors present are before you. A bright white light beckons you to follow it left. It gives off a warm and comfortable feeling. However, the crimson red light to your right makes you cower in fear. It doesn't seem to want you to follow it."
vampire.5.a:0 "Follow the White Light"
vampire.5.b:0 "Follow the Crimson Light"
vampire.6.t:0 "Divination"
vampire.6.d:0 "As you follow the white light, it seems to whisper words of approval to you. It gives you an overwhelming feeling of joy as it guides you through beautiful landscapes. Finally, it leads you back to your room. Before leaving, the white light whispers a few secrets in your ear that leave you dumbfounded."
vampire.6.a:0 "With this knowledge... I can do anything"
vampire.7.t:0 "The Worst Choice"
vampire.7.d:0 "As you brush off the mortal feeling of fear, you follow the crimson light. The crimson light appears irritated, but brings you along its path. The path it follows is full of destruction and pain. Scenes of razed villages, everconsuming fires, and eldritch horrors threaten to break your mind. However, you remain steadfast and follow the little crimson light. Finally, it brings you back to your room in the citadel. Chained to the wall is your son, a child of your own blood. As a knife materializes in your hands, you panic. "Stop! What are you doing to me!?" As you speak, your vision breaks apart into various shades of red."
vampire.7.a:0 "Stab his carotid artery and watch him bleed"

vampire.7.e:0 "Break his spinal vertebrae one by one up to the neck"
vampire.7.f:0 "Rip open his stomach and disembowel him"
vampire.8.t:0 "Ascension"
vampire.8.d:0 "As you let the feeling of power consume you, the Black Jade inserts itself into your heart and becomes one with you. A thick layer of shadow envelops you. As you walk into the throne room, everyone around you desperately claws at their throat. Every step you takes casts shadows in all direction and causes the floor to tremble. As you take your rightful seat on the black throne, you glance towards your subordinates writhing in pain. The Black Jade whispers something into your ear, and you can't stop the corners of your lips from rising."
